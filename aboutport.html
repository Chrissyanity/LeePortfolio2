      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
  <p>By the time you read this, my birthday will have just passed on January 10th. So I am now 26 years old. I currently work in Manufactoring at one of the Big Three companies here in Michigan. I have been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. I started out in Robotics in elementary school and continued with DAPCEP throughout middle school. However, by the time I started high school, engineering and technolgy was not something that was stressed to young women in the same way that it was stressed to young men.</p>
  <p>In my free time I LOVEEE binge-watching new TV shows and watching movies. I just recently finished watching a new show on Netflix called <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635282/">The OA</strong></a>, it was pretty good but I personally think that it could have ended better. I also enjoy reading and discovering new music before all of my friends so I seem cooler (LOL). The three books I have to finish before our bootcamp officially begins are:<ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Man">Invisible Man - Ralph Ellison</li></a>
    <li><a href="http://javascriptbook.com">JavaScript and jQuery - Jon Duckett</li></a>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Wellness-Transforming-Jealousy-Creative/dp/030733788X">Emotional Wellness - Osho</li></a></ol></p>
    <p>I'm so excited to begin this next phase of my life and career! It's never too late to learn a new skill and I welcome this challenge with open arms.</p>
